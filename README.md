# WebAudio Module Player
This is a JavaScript/WebAudio port of a Java 1.8 version that was a port of some C++ code I found, 
details of which are lost to me it was so long ago.

It uses the deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode` instead of the new `AudioWorklet` approach, so it may cease to function at some point if and when the deprecated 
feature is dropped.
