# Amiga Module Player - Web Audio Demo

This is a JavaScript/WebAudio port of a Java 1.8 version that was 
itself a port of some C++ code I found, details of which are lost 
in time and space. 

It uses the deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode` instead of the 
new `AudioWorklet` approach, so it may cease to function at 
some point.
